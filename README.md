CanSat Ghana is a foundation (NGO) focussed on helping Ghana develop its Space sector through building experimental satellites (CanSats). 
In the last two years, we have reached 600+ students in Ghana. 
Our goal is to help students to build and learn about experimental satellites while going through the complete process of an actual Space mission.

A CanSat is a simulation of an actual satellite enclosed in the volume and shape of a standard soft drink can (115 mm height, 66 mm diameter and 300g weight). 
It features all major systems of a satellite such as power, payload, communication and recovery systems. All systems except the parachute, radio antenna, and GPS antenna must be enclosed in the can. 
A typical CanSat mission is characterised by a launch into the atmosphere by a balloon, drone or a small rocket with the primary mission of measuring and monitoring atmospheric air pollution and an optional secondary mission. 
Data acquired is transmitted to the ground station via radio telemetry until the CanSat is recovered. Generally, CanSats are launched to an altitude ranging from 670m to 725m and do not leave the atmosphere or orbit the earth.
